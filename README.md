# Tensorflow 2 - A Crash Course

This repo contains two Jupyter notebooks:
- One with questions
- And, another one with solutions

This is intended to act as a refresher for Tensorflow 2.

To practice using these notebooks, follow these steps:
- Install Python 3.12
- Create a virtual environment (You may use `conda`, `virtualenv`, or any other package)
- Activate the environment
- Install `notebook` and `tensorflow` in the new environment
- Start a `jupyter` server using `jupyter notebook` command
